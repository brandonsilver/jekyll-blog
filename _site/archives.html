    <h3><a href=" /2013/03/31/Major-site-overhaul.html "> Major site overhaul </a></h3>
    <p>This past spring break I decided that I <em>really</em> needed to dust off my website
and start using it for what I originally intended: documenting the neat projects
I work on, writing about the topics that interest me, and serving as a hub for
my overall Internet presence. The improvements I've made should hopefully put
some momentum behind that. In short, I made some layout changes to the site to
make it more readable, aquired a Class 2 SSL Certificate from StartSSL, and
am switching my personal e-mail address to <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#98;&#x72;&#x61;&#110;&#100;&#111;&#x6e;&#64;&#x62;&#x72;&#97;&#110;&#100;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#115;&#105;&#108;&#x76;&#x65;&#114;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#98;&#114;&#x61;&#x6e;&#100;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#x40;&#98;&#114;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x64;&#111;&#110;&#x73;&#105;&#x6c;&#x76;&#x65;&#114;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#109;</a> (with
a new GPG key to go with it).</p>

    <h3><a href=" /2012/02/16/New-Notes-Website.html "> New Notes Website </a></h3>
    <p>I've just finished making a seperate website for my school notes. You can find it at <a href="http://notes.brandonsilver.com/">notes.brandonsilver.com</a>.
I started it mostly because I already took my Computer Science II notes in markdown, and I wanted a more
readable medium for those notes than just vim. Plus, others in my class might be interested as well, so I went ahead
and started a new <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki">jekyll-based</a> site for those notes, complete with fancy <a href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments</a> syntax highlighting for the
multitude of Java code fragments.</p>

    <h3><a href=" /2011/07/16/Summer-Update.html "> Summer Update </a></h3>
    <p>This summer started out uneventful enough. For most of June I didn't do
very much. Sure, I did tidy up the yard a bit, but not a whole lot besides that.</p>

    <h3><a href=" /2011/05/30/And-we%27re-back%21.html "> And we're back! </a></h3>
    <p>After a brief hiatus the cause of which I am too embarrassed to speak of, brandonsilver.com is back up and running. On a completely unrelated note, I would highly recommend NOT allowing your domains to expire in order to re-register in the hopes of doing so more cheaply than an actual transfer. When they expire, they automatically fall into a 30-day limbo of sorts where no one can re-register them save for the original registrant (and a lot of good that does if you've canceled your account with said registrant). Basically, find a good domain host <strong>and stick with it</strong>.</p>

<p>Any who, what have I been up to these past months sans-website? I've been pretty busy, actually, what with graduating high school and all. Hopefully I'll stay busy through the summer and not go stir-crazy with boredom at home.</p>

    <h3><a href=" /2011/03/04/minecraft-on-amazon-ec2.html "> Minecraft Server on an Amazon EC2 Micro Instance </a></h3>
    <p>Over the past couple of weeks, I've been using my free Amazon EC2 Micro instance as a <a href="http://www.minecraft.net">Minecraft</a> server. It isn't ideal, but it works well enough to replace the aging PC I was using before. Plus, I can feel safe allowing people onto the server, as before I would have to expose my home network to the Internet for the same experience.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2013-05-09:</strong> I've added a section on how to add swap space to EC2.
This can alleviate problems encountered when more than a couple of players are
on the server.</p>

    <h3><a href=" /2011/02/08/the-dawn-of-a-new-blog.html "> The Dawn of a New Blog </a></h3>
    <p>Another day, another new blog setup. As you may or may not have noticed, I've switched from Wordpress to a new, more lightweight system called Jekyll. It'll allow me the freedom to write up my posts how I see fit and (hopefully) finally give me the motivation to learn some HTML and CSS.</p>
