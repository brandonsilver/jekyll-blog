<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>I manage a few WordPress websites in my spare time. Most of the sites don’t have comments enabled,
but a few do, so on occasion I’ll be alerted to new comments. The majority of those comments are
spam (usually having something to do with advertising SEO opportunities) and thus are left in the
purgatory of the moderation queue. However, one would-be comment was different from the usual
fake-SEO tripe. This post will examine this particular comment and explore its malicious properties.</p>

    <p>This past spring break I decided that I <em>really</em> needed to dust off my website
and start using it for what I originally intended: documenting the neat projects
I work on, writing about the topics that interest me, and serving as a hub for
my overall Internet presence. The improvements I’ve made should hopefully put
some momentum behind that. In short, I made some layout changes to the site to
make it more readable, aquired a Class 2 SSL Certificate from StartSSL, and
am switching my personal e-mail address to <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#098;&#114;&#097;&#110;&#100;&#111;&#110;&#064;&#098;&#114;&#097;&#110;&#100;&#111;&#110;&#115;&#105;&#108;&#118;&#101;&#114;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">&#098;&#114;&#097;&#110;&#100;&#111;&#110;&#064;&#098;&#114;&#097;&#110;&#100;&#111;&#110;&#115;&#105;&#108;&#118;&#101;&#114;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;</a> (with
a new GPG key to go with it).</p>

    <h2 class="post"><a href=" /2012/02/16/New-Notes-Website.html "> New Notes Website </a></h2>
    <p>I’ve just finished making a seperate website for my school notes. You can find it at <a href="http://notes.brandonsilver.com/">notes.brandonsilver.com</a>.
I started it mostly because I already took my Computer Science II notes in markdown, and I wanted a more
readable medium for those notes than just vim. Plus, others in my class might be interested as well, so I went ahead
and started a new <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki">jekyll-based</a> site for those notes, complete with fancy <a href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments</a> syntax highlighting for the
multitude of Java code fragments.</p>

    <p>This summer started out uneventful enough. For most of June I didn’t do
very much. Sure, I did tidy up the yard a bit, but not a whole lot besides that.</p>

    <p>After a brief hiatus the cause of which I am too embarrassed to speak of, brandonsilver.com is back up and running. On a completely unrelated note, I would highly recommend NOT allowing your domains to expire in order to re-register in the hopes of doing so more cheaply than an actual transfer. When they expire, they automatically fall into a 30-day limbo of sorts where no one can re-register them save for the original registrant (and a lot of good that does if you’ve canceled your account with said registrant). Basically, find a good domain host <strong>and stick with it</strong>.</p>

<p>Any who, what have I been up to these past months sans-website? I’ve been pretty busy, actually, what with graduating high school and all. Hopefully I’ll stay busy through the summer and not go stir-crazy with boredom at home.</p>

    <p>Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve been using my free Amazon EC2 Micro instance as a <a href="http://www.minecraft.net">Minecraft</a> server. It isn’t ideal, but it works well enough to replace the aging PC I was using before. Plus, I can feel safe allowing people onto the server, as before I would have to expose my home network to the Internet for the same experience.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2013-05-09:</strong> I’ve added a section on how to add swap space to EC2.
This can alleviate problems encountered when more than a couple of players are
on the server.</p>

    <p>Another day, another new blog setup. As you may or may not have noticed, I’ve switched from Wordpress to a new, more lightweight system called Jekyll. It’ll allow me the freedom to write up my posts how I see fit and (hopefully) finally give me the motivation to learn some HTML and CSS.</p>
