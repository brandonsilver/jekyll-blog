<p>Well, today was the final day of school for the 2009-2010 school year. I attended school for only a few hours as it was pretty much deserted except for teachers and those few enterprising students (such as myself). </p>


<p>Continuing from Page (44), I managed to resolve my little grade predicament. I read _Of Mice and Men_ for extra credit in AP English Language and took the verbal quiz of sorts this morning before school started. That _should_ have only bumped my grade to an 89, but Mr. Hunter took pity on me and made it an A :). Unfortunately, my AP Chemistry grade remains a B, but seeing as how its such a difficult class I certainly do not have any regrets grade-wise (and neither do my parents). </p>

<p>So tl;dr I escaped certain doom yet again. Fuck yeah. </p>


<p>Going back to the whole last-day-of-school thing. I met up with Cody and his somewhat annoying friend Collin (I think that was his name) after I took the extra credit quiz in AP Lang. We hang out for a while in the Cafeteria, with myself playing Half-life 2 on my MacBook and Cody and Collin embroiled in a childish debate on the existence of God and religion. I didn't pay much attention to the argument, so I guess I can't really give a true account of it. </p>

<p>Eventually Cody got bored and prodded us over to the Auditorium (I'm unsure as to whether I have written of our exploits there or not, so let's just say that Cody and I knew the place like the back of our hands). All of the ground-level doors were locked, but one of the doors up on the balcony wasn't, allowing us to go up there and mill around aimlessly for a time. I eventually grew bored of this pursuit and made my way over to the Yearbook room, Cody and Collin trailing behind. We then surfed around the web for a while (and I played some Half-life). </p>

<p>Eventually, Cody and I left school to go look around Mitch Park for this party KC had told us about. There was no such party to be found, so we went back to my house for a while. I had suggested the day before that we should go to Senor Tequilas for lunch, so we made our way over there and had lunch and left. We stopped by a Dollar General that was next door and purchased two foam swords for an epic sword fight later on. </p>

<p>The sword fight ended when my sword broke, so we went back inside and watched the new Star Trek movie on my brothers' PS3. After the movie I took Cody home.</p>

<p>And that's when the fun kinda ended. My mom got a call from Cody's, and apparently spilled the proverbial beans. My mother told Cody's that we had just left our hose, when in fact Cody had told her that we had left school. See, Cody's parents are total jerkwads, and get pissed at even the slightest misstep. As such, Cody didn't mention that he and I had ditched school to hang out (although I must stress that we didn't 'ditch' school in the normal meaning as absolutely none of the teachers were taking attendance today, it being not only after graduation but also after all of the final exams had been taken). Cody only said that I was taking him home from school, which was of course a lie (kind of). It can be inferred from all of this that I shouldn't be hearing from him for quite some time.</p>


<p>And to top it all off, my web hosting expires next Tuesday. Fun.</p>



<p>I plan on switching to a different kind of webhost called NearlyFreeSpeech.net. They don't have yearly contracts, it's a pay-as-you-go service quite similar to Amazon's S3 service (which I currently use). I've done the math and it will be _MUCH_ cheaper than going with Dreamhost for another year ($30-40 a year compared with $100). It's very minimalist, which for me is good. The only thing I don't like about NFS is that it doesn't (yet) support cron jobs, which are currently INSANELY useful to me. That, and easy WebDAV. Not that I'm using WebDAV much more anyways...</p>

<p>So right now:  I'm currently downloading all of my websites from Dreamhost, databases and all. For the new webhosting I'll need to trim my current footprint significantly in order for it to work, but that shouldn't be much of a problem. It will definitely be interesting to see how efficient my web presence can get.</p>
