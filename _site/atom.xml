   <title>New Notes Website</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've just finished making a seperate website for my school notes. You can find it at &lt;a href=&quot;http://notes.brandonsilver.com/&quot;&gt;notes.brandonsilver.com&lt;/a&gt;.
I started it mostly because I already took my Computer Science II notes in markdown, and I wanted a more
readable medium for those notes than just vim. Plus, others in my class might be interested as well, so I went ahead
and started a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki&quot;&gt;jekyll-based&lt;/a&gt; site for those notes, complete with fancy &lt;a href=&quot;http://pygments.org/&quot;&gt;Pygments&lt;/a&gt; syntax highlighting for the
multitude of Java code fragments.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Summer Update</title>
   <link href="http://www.brandonsilver.com/2011/07/16/Summer-Update.html"/>
   <updated>2011-07-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.brandonsilver.com/2011/07/16/Summer-Update</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This summer started out uneventful enough. For most of June I didn't do
very much. Sure, I did tidy up the yard a bit, but not a whole lot besides that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Volunteer Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2011/07/16/hopecenter.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image of the HOPE Center of Edmond&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, toward the end of June I started volunteering at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hopecenterofedmond.com&quot;&gt;Hope Center of Edmond&lt;/a&gt;,
specifically in their food pantry. The folks over at the HOPE Center are a
pleasure to work with, and I feel like I am making a positive contribution
to our community. Overall I am very grateful for the experience
that the HOPE Center has provided me with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Actual Employment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also been working as a waiter at &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=3401404715024300847&amp;amp;q=Al's+Cafe+and+Grill,+Edmond,+OK&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ved=0CBAQ-gswAA&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=oOYfTuDOFZCUzATw942UBA&amp;amp;sig2=KN3QWgRGOPPQ1VY8mO0fEw&quot;&gt;Al's Cafe and Grill&lt;/a&gt; for the past two and a half
weeks. It's a small, old-fashioned onion burger joint that also has some delicious daily specials.
The work is hard (and at times, messy too) but I love to work there. Everyday I learn something new
and interesting about the restaurant business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;More Employment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if all of that wasn't enough, I'm also doing contractual work for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stammwebcreations.com/&quot;&gt;Stamm Web Creations&lt;/a&gt;.
I'm mostly building and managing WordPress-based websites, but I do other tech-related jobs
for them as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that's what I've been up to so far this summer. When school is close to starting I'll post a summer-in-review post too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>And we're back!</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a brief hiatus the cause of which I am too embarrassed to speak of, brandonsilver.com is back up and running. On a completely unrelated note, I would highly recommend NOT allowing your domains to expire in order to re-register in the hopes of doing so more cheaply than an actual transfer. When they expire, they automatically fall into a 30-day limbo of sorts where no one can re-register them save for the original registrant (and a lot of good that does if you've canceled your account with said registrant). Basically, find a good domain host &lt;strong&gt;and stick with it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any who, what have I been up to these past months sans-website? I've been pretty busy, actually, what with graduating high school and all. Hopefully I'll stay busy through the summer and not go stir-crazy with boredom at home.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Minecraft Server on an Amazon EC2 Micro Instance</title>
   <link href="http://www.brandonsilver.com/2011/03/04/minecraft-on-amazon-ec2.html"/>
   <updated>2011-03-04T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.brandonsilver.com/2011/03/04/minecraft-on-amazon-ec2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of weeks, I've been using my free Amazon EC2 Micro instance as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.minecraft.net&quot;&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt; server. It isn't ideal, but it works well enough to replace the aging PC I was using before. Plus, I can feel safe allowing people onto the server, as before I would have to expose my home network to the Internet for the same experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This post assumes that you already have a running instance. If you are interested in setting up your own EC2 Instance from scratch, have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stratumsecurity.com/blog/2010/12/03/shearing-firesheep-with-the-cloud/&quot;&gt;http://www.stratumsecurity.com/blog/2010/12/03/shearing-firesheep-with-the-cloud/&lt;/a&gt;. It also shows you how to setup an OpenVPN server.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it is my first Minecraft server, I decided to use the vanilla server from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.minecraft.net/download.jsp&quot;&gt;Mojang Specifications&lt;/a&gt;. It isn't as feature-packed as others like HeyO, but it is relatively simple to get going. My instance (Ubuntu Server 10.04, ami-4a0df923 on EC2) didn't have the Java Runtime Environment pre-installed, so I installed it using apt-get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then proceeded to download the latest version of the server:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I also made sure that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/&quot;&gt;GNU screen&lt;/a&gt; was installed so I could run minecraft-server in the background between SSH sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I am running the server in a low-memory environment, I adjusted the instructions given on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.minecraft.net/download.jsp&quot;&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; to suit and put it all in a small startup script, start.sh, which I placed in the same directory as minecraft-server.jar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should allow the server to startup without error. Make sure that start.sh has executable permissions via &lt;code&gt;chmod +x start.sh&lt;/code&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it's time to start the server with the following commands, replacing &lt;code&gt;/path/to/minecraft-server&lt;/code&gt; with whatever path you downloaded minecraft-server.jar to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should now be at the minecraft server console. For the final step, you need to adjust your Amazon EC2 Security Policy to allow TCP connections to port 25565. After that, you can finally fire up Minecraft, go to Multiplayer, and punch in your server's public IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Practicality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The free tier that Amazon provides is just enough bandwidth, CPU power, and memory for small groups of no more than four players. That means it's only any good as a personal creative server that you can show off to friends every now and then. But hey, free is free, and if you follow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stratumsecurity.com/blog/2010/12/03/shearing-firesheep-with-the-cloud&quot;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; at Stratum Security, you'll have a nice little OpenVPN server too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Dawn of a New Blog</title>
   <link href="http://www.brandonsilver.com/2011/02/08/the-dawn-of-a-new-blog.html"/>
   <updated>2011-02-08T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.brandonsilver.com/2011/02/08/the-dawn-of-a-new-blog</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another day, another new blog setup. As you may or may not have noticed, I've switched from Wordpress to a new, more lightweight system called Jekyll. It'll allow me the freedom to write up my posts how I see fit and (hopefully) finally give me the motivation to learn some HTML and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first learned about Jekyll from &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-wordpress-to-jekyll&quot;&gt;Paul Stamatiou's Blog&lt;/a&gt;. Its support for a variety of markup languages (including markdown) and lack of a requirement for a database sold me on the idea. I have long desired a completely &quot;flat&quot; replacement for Wordpress, and Jekyll looked like just the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial setup wasn't too dificult. Even with my somewhat limited understanding of web development, I was able to follow along Paul's excellent post, creating a local development environment and using Github to clone a popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/tpw&quot;&gt;Jekyll repository&lt;/a&gt;. A few dozen modifications later, and a new blog is born in lightweight and beautiful static HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
