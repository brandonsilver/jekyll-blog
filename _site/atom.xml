   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another day, another new blog setup. As you may or may not have noticed, I've switched from Wordpress to a new, more lightweight system called Jekyll. It'll allow me the freedom to write up my posts how I see fit and (hopefully) finally give me the motivation to learn some HTML and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first learned about Jekyll from &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-wordpress-to-jekyll&quot;&gt;Paul Stamatiou's Blog&lt;/a&gt;. Its support for a variety of markup languages (including markdown) and lack of a requirement for a database sold me on the idea. I have long desired a completely &quot;flat&quot; replacement for Wordpress, and Jekyll looked like just the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial setup wasn't too dificult. Even with my somewhat limited understanding of web development, I was able to follow along Paul's excellent post, creating a local development environment and using Github to clone a popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/tpw&quot;&gt;Jekyll repository&lt;/a&gt;. A few dozen modifications later, and a new blog is born in lightweight and beautiful static HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
