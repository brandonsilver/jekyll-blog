As a gesture toward posting more often, I've now added an archive to the blog. That way there won't be a bunch of links
cluttering up the front page once the posts begin to accumulate. Additionally, I've put up
[a link to my school notes for this new semester](https://www.evernote.com/pub/bas1/2012fall). I'm enrolled in Discrete
Mathematics, Calculus II, C++ Programming, and Physics II, so be sure to check them out if you're interested.
