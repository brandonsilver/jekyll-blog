Almost a year has passed since my last post.

In my [previous post](/2013/03/31/Major-site-overhaul.html), I made a resolution of sorts:
I was going to "dust off my website and start using it" to document what I'm up to.
Obviously, that's not what happened. Instead, I've (yet again) let other activities and
obligations get in the way, many of which are a genuine waste of time (reddit, I'm looking
at you).

This time around, I'm not making any promises or resolutions. But I will say that I
recognize my desire to make this place what I've always wanted it to be: my slice of the
web, owned and operated by me.
