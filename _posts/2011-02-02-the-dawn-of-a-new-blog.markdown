title: The Dawn of a New Blog

After reading about Jekyll at [Paul Stamatiou's Blog](http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-wordpress-to-jekyll), I thought that maybe I'd give it a try. I needed more experience in XHTML/CSS, and the idea of having everything in markdown sans-database was too attractive to pass over. 

It wasn't too dificult a process. I more or less followed along Paul's excellent post, creating a local development environment and using Github to clone a popular [Jekyll repository](https://github.com/mojombo/tpw), modifying it and the XHTML template I found as needed. And then, presto! Here we are.
