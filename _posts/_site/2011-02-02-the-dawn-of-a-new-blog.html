<p>I first learned about Jekyll from <a href='http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-wordpress-to-jekyll'>Paul Stamatiou&#8217;s Blog</a>. Its support for a variety of markup languages (including markdown) and lack of a requirement for a database sold me on the idea. I have long desired a completely &#8220;flat&#8221; replacement for Wordpress, and Jekyll looked like just the ticket.</p>

<p>The initial setup wasn&#8217;t too dificult. Even with my somewhat limited understanding of web development, I was able to follow along Paul&#8217;s excellent post, creating a local development environment and using Github to clone a popular <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/tpw'>Jekyll repository</a>. A few dozen modifications later, and a new blog is born in lightweight and beautiful static HTML.</p>
